# ORNL AI Initiative: Secure, Trustworthy, and Energy-Efficient AI for Science Tutorial Series

ORNL [AI Initiative](https://www.ornl.gov/ai-initiative)’s tutorial series is designed to equip the scientific community with cutting-edge methodologies, technologies developed within ORNL and specifically through the AI initiative.

Each half-day tutorial is structured to cover a broad spectrum of **AI for science** applications, from graph neural networks in materials modeling to machine learning in hyperspectral image reconstruction.

The tutorials are designed for researchers of all levels who seek to deepen their understanding of AI for Science.
Our primary audience includes researchers with a foundation in AI, aiming to explore and implement advanced, trustworthy AI techniques within scientific contexts.
Additionally, we invite researchers and practitioners from the industry, as well as graduate, postgraduate, and undergraduate students from universities who are engaged in AI research and aspire to acquire knowledge specifically in AI for science.
Although we will touch upon fundamental concepts in AI for science, our curriculum does not encompass introductory AI topics.

The tutorials will place a strong emphasis on open-source principles and non-sensitive topics and content.
We will share open-source code, provide detailed code walkthroughs, and offer hands-on exercises to enhance learning and engagement.

The tutorials will be held **virtually**, allowing participants to join virtually.
Microsoft Teams link will be announced.

Registration is not required for ORNL participants.
For non-ORNL participants, an entry pass is required even for virtual attendance.
For non-US citizens, this process may take up to **45** days.
Please email Jessica Woods at woodsjb@ornl.gov **and** Taylor Bullock at bullocktm@ornl.gov. 
Include a short bio and explain why you wish to attend the tutorial series.
Note that the tutorials will be recorded and made available online after 2-3 weeks.
Therefore, please request an entry pass only if you need to attend virtually.

**Abstract**

During the tutorial, we will show how to use HydraGNN (https://github.com/ORNL/HydraGNN), our scalable implementation of multi-task learning graph neural networks developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory #ORNL as part of the ORNL Artificial Intelligence Initiative.
After discussing scientific motivations behind the need to develop scalable GNN training to support scientific applications of interest to the US Department of Energy (DOE), we will cover a hands-on session with examples of increasing difficulty. In particular, we will show how HydraGNN can be used to scale the training of GNN models on millions of atomic structures on OLCF-Summit, NERSC-Perlmutter, and OLCF-Frontier. To this day, we achieved linear scaling on these DOE leadership class supercomputing facilities using up to 1,024 GPUs.

**Abstract**

Training machine learning models on data with privacy concerns is an increasingly common and needed situation.
Differential privacy provides a mathematical framework for rigorously guaranteeing privacy while releasing information—roughly speaking, one makes a deterministic algorithm into a randomized algorithm (e.g., by adding noise to the output) in such a way that it masks the original data.
Of course, accuracy is sacrificed for the gain of privacy.
Unfortunately, the state of the art in differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD), which is the state of the art for private machine learning, is inadequate in practice as it leads to insufficient accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.
How can we transform this field to produces sufficiently accurate models while simultaneously protecting our privacy?
This talk presents our work to explore a new approach to differentially private machine learning.  
 
First necessary background will be given.
I’ll provide an introduction to differential privacy requiring no background in the field with a focus on differentially private machine learning.
Our target is understanding the state of the art, DPSGD.
The second portion of background material will introduce normalizing flows models—a family of deep learning neural networks that, by design, preserve probability densities, and hence can be used to approximate intractable probability densities.
Basic understanding of supervised machine learning and neural networks is required.
 
Once equipped with the needed background, I’ll present our new approach, ExpM+NF.
This exploratory project investigates if we can use the Exponential Mechanism—a differential privacy mechanism for optimization—to train machine learning models with privacy.
Historically, the exponential mechanism has been sidelined as it requires sampling from an intractable distribution.
Can normalizing flow models, deep neural networks designed for handling intractable distributions be the key?
Our year 1 work seeks to answer the question "Can we train a model by sampling from the exponential mechanism via an auxiliary normalizing flow?".
Experiments and results will be presented. Our current (year 2) work seeks to prove a differential privacy guarantee that incorporates the normalizing flow's approximation to the "real" exponential mechanism distribution.

**Abstract**

In machine learning (ML), understanding and quantifying prediction uncertainties is crucial, particularly when decisions rely on ML outputs.
In this tutorial, we will introduce PI3NN (https://github.com/liusiyan/UQnet), a prediction interval-based method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) of ML models.

We will begin with an overview of UQ in ML, discussing its significance and impact across various research fields.
We will then explore the basics of the PI3NN method, providing practical examples to demonstrate its broad applicability in diverse scientific domains.
The tutorial will include a hands-on session where participants can familiarize themselves with this method through examples that include dense neural networks with synthetic data and Long Short-Term Memory networks with real observations.
We will guide participants step-by-step through the process in a Google Colab Notebook format, enhancing both understanding and practical skills.

**Bio**

William is an R&D associate in the Nuclear Energy and Fuel Cycle Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
He currently works with the Power Reactor Modeling group developing performant software solutions to address industry identified challenge problems.
His research interests include applying Bayesian statistics and machine learning to reactor physics problems.
As the principle investigator of a laboratory directed research and development project, William developed a flexible parallel optimization package, ML-PSA, that joins modern machine learning methods with multi-fidelity physics tools to solve multi-constrained and combinatorial optimization problems encountered in reactor core design. 

William co-developed the crud simulation code, MAMBA, that is a coupled component of the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA).
MAMBA allows prediction of crud-induced power shifts, constituting a key capability in the Consortium for the Advanced Simulation of LWRs' (CASL) technical portfolio.
Additionally, he develops reduced order models and applies statistical inference techniques to a variety of model calibration tasks in MAMBA and CTF.

William holds a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (2013), an M.S.E. in Mechanical Engineering (2015) and a Ph.D. in Nuclear & Radiation Engineering (2018) from the University of Texas at Austin.
In his doctoral work, William developed a statistical downscaling method to capture the influence of fine-scale flow details down stream from spacer grids on the growth rate of crud in PWRs.
