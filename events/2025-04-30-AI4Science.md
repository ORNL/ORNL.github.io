The US Department of Energy (DOE) launched the Advancements in Artificial Intelligence for Science Funding Opportunity Program to accelerate the development and application of AI in the DOE Office of Science Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program. The focus of ASCR research and
development investments is on the underlying approaches for AI-enhanced scientific and
engineering capabilities and to significantly transform the scientific method for accelerated discovery and innovation. It is therefore critical to
enable trustworthy AI for scientific applications advancing human understanding and
addressing national needs.

# Aims and Scope

<p align="justify">
Organized by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the lab is hosting a first workshop across projects funded by the AI4Science program. The workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to share their research, discuss challenges, and foster collaborations across areas. The workshop will also provide an opportunity for participants to engage with the broader scientific community at ORNL.
