# Aims and Scope

<p align="justify">
While scientific software is an important component in the pursuit of scientific discovery, software development in high-performance computing (HPC) continues to be challenging. The software development process today combines contributions from domain scientists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and involves complex programming models. As a result of these diverse contributions software environments have become significantly complicated and expensive. <br /> 

With this increasing diversity, the complexity of software development increases and it requires a steep learning curve for new developers, resulting in a slower pace of software development. With the continuous integration of scientific applications in complex, deep software stacks (workflows, compilers, runtime libraries, heterogeneous systems) novel techniques and practical tools for assisting the software development in HPC are invaluable. Recent advances in generative AI and large language models, such as GitHub’s Copilot, OpenAI’s GPT, Meta’s Llama, among others, demonstrate already that they can perform important tasks in the HPC and scientific software development, such as verification & validation, generation of optimized code, code translation, porting of applications, etc.  <br /> 

The goal of the AI Assisted Software Development for High-performance Computing (HPC) workshop (AI4Dev) is to create a forum composed of researchers, scientists, application developers, computing centers, and industry staff to discuss ideas on how artificial intelligence can help in the whole process of HPC software development. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in the area.
