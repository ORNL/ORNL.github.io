<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
While computing technologies have remained relatively stable for nearly two decades, new architectural features, such as specialized hardware, 
heterogeneous cores, deep memory hierarchies, and near-memory processing, have emerged as possible solutions to address the concerns of energy efficiency, 
manufacturability, and cost. However, we expect this ‘golden age’ of architectural change to lead to extreme heterogeneity and will have a major impact on 
software systems and applications. In this upcoming exascale and extreme heterogeneity era, it will be critical to explore new software approaches that 
will enable us to effectively exploit this diverse hardware to advance science, the next-generation systems with heterogeneous elements will need to 
accommodate complex workflows. This is mainly due to the many forms of heterogeneous accelerators (no longer just GPU accelerators) in this heterogeneous 
era, and the need to map different parts of an application onto elements most appropriate for that application component. In addition, this year we 
acknowledge the increasing need for Co-Design. This topic will explore the methodologies, challenges, and opportunities in the co-design of hardware, 
software, and applications to achieve optimal performance, power efficiency, and productivity in the era of extreme heterogeneity.

<h2><strong>Keynote (Taisuke Boku, Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba):</strong></h2> <strong>Extreme Heterogeneity on HPC/AI - What is the next stage?</strong><font color="#FFFFFF"><img src="./images/T-Boku-face.jpg" alt="Dr. Taisuke Boku" border="1" align="right" class="right" width="400" height="auto"/></font>
<p>
Heterogeneous supercomputing is the common methodology for advanced
HPC/AI processing especially to respond ultra-high demand of computing
performance within limited power limitation. GPU is the most commonly
used device which enables very high degree of instruction level
parallelism with a huge number of SIMD cores and wide memory bandwidth
supported by HBM technology. Moreover, the latest GPUs are equipped
with high computation capability on dense/sparse matrix with low
precision which is suitable for advanced AI processing such as machine
learning or LLM. Even on HPC algorithms, such a feature is also applied
instead of brute-force FP64 computation by hardware. Another complexity of GPU computing is the combination of GPU and CPU
which have been in a discrete platform connected by traditional PCIe
bus and are now combined in a single module as like as NVIDIA GH200 or AMD
MI300A. This technology opens a new era of GPU computing based on
hardware support for shared address space on memories of multiple
devices. However, the method to realize this feature depends on the
vendors, and the performance optimization is not in a simple
manner. The performance portability on multi-vendor devices is also
a big challenge. It implies the other accelerators such as FPGA. In this talk, I summarize current technology on accelerated and
heterogeneous computing represented with GPU devices and other ones,
the characteristics of hybrid GPU/CPU modules with multiple vendors,
how to program them, and what is the next challenge of new generation
of heterogeneous computing. In the talk, I will also mention on
Japan's next generation national flagship supercomputer and its
supporting organizations.

<h2><strong>Invited Speaker (Allen D. Malony, University of Oregon):</strong></h2> <strong>Extreme Heterogeneity Demands Extreme Observability</strong>
<p>
The extreme heterogeneity era, coupled with strong interests in exascale and AI computing, will significantly increase the complexity of next-generation HPC systems, applications programming/optimization, workflow execution, power/energy management, and more.  Post-Moore computer architecture innovations are driving heterogeneity and hardware specialization, resulting in a diversity of processors, accelerators, memory, and interconnects.  While there is certainly opportunities to build more powerful HPC systems based on these technology advances, the operational complexity of the heterogeneous system as a whole could make
it challenging to achieve its full computational potential.  A proposition is presented in the talk that heterogeneity in future HPC systems will necessitate greater support for observability.  Indeed, a stronger argument will be made that observability should be an integral, comprehensive aspect of the systems design overall and that specific hardware and software dedicated to observability needs to be developed. The conclusion of this argument is that future HPC systems and the applications that run on them will not be able to deliver their full capabilities unless extreme observability is present.
