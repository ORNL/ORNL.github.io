<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Since their development and release, modern Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model and the Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), have come to signify a revolution in human-computer interaction spurred on by their high-quality results. LLMs have repaved this landscape thanks to unprecedented investments and enormous training models (hundreds of billions of parameters). The availability of LLMs has led to increasing interest in how they could be applied to a large variety of applications. The HPC community made recent research efforts to evaluate current LLM capabilities for some HPC tasks, including code generation, auto parallelization, performance portability, correctness, among others. All these studies concluded that state-of-the-art LLM capabilities have proven so far insufficient for these targets. Hence, it is necessary to explore novel techniques to further empower LLMs to enrich the HPC mission and its impact.

<h2><strong>Keynote (Rio Yokota, Institute of Science Tokio):</strong></h2> <strong>Updates on the Development of Japanese LLMs</strong>
<p>
Large language models (LLM) are mainly pre-trained on internet data, which is predominantly English. Such models have suboptimal performance when used in non-English languages. Also, LLMs are not mechanical tools that benefit everyone equally. They are rather intellectual tools that disproportionately benefit certain groups of people, depending on what data they are trained on. Furthermore, the interaction with LLMs will influence our local culture in the long term. Sovereign LLMs are crucial for customizing the models to meet the needs of each local culture. In this talk I will give an update of the efforts in Japan to train LLMs. I will cover both the data and training aspects.

<h2><strong>Invited Talk (Min Si, Facebook AI):</strong></h2> <strong>High performance communication library and transport for LLM training at 100K+ Scale</strong>
<p>
Each successive generation of the LLaMA model has demonstrated substantial growth in both model size and complexity. The largest multimodal mixture-of-experts model within our LLaMA4 series possesses nearly two trillion total parameters, with 288 billion active parameters and 16 experts. To accommodate the computational demands associated with training such a colossal model, we expanded our AI clusters, deploying approximately 100,000 GPUs. GPU-to-GPU communication latency is a critical factor when coordinating such a vast number of GPUs. Even microsecond delays accumulate across thousands of nodes, consequently impacting the time required for training. We engineered the underlying network infrastructure to provide the necessary backbone for high-speed GPU-to-GPU communication, concurrently innovating our communication library stack to enhance overall communication efficiency. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the network topology deployed within Meta datacenters and introduce a range of communication optimizations and custom features that facilitated LLaMA4 training through cross-layer codesign, encompassing model algorithms, collectives, and extending to the network transport layer.
