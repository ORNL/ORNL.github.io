<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Since their development and release, modern Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model and the Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), have come to signify a revolution in human-computer interaction spurred on by their high-quality results. LLMs have repaved this landscape thanks to unprecedented investments and enormous training models (hundreds of billions of parameters). The availability of LLMs has led to increasing interest in how they could be applied to a large variety of applications. The HPC community made recent research efforts to evaluate current LLM capabilities for some HPC tasks, including code generation, auto parallelization, performance portability, correctness, among others. All these studies concluded that state-of-the-art LLM capabilities have proven so far insufficient for these targets. Hence, it is necessary to explore novel techniques to further empower LLMs to enrich the HPC mission and its impact.

<h2><strong>Keynote Speaker (Daichi Mukunoki, Nagoya University):</strong></h2> <strong>Exploring Multi-Agent Systems for HPC Code Development</strong>

<p>
Recent advances in code generation AI have demonstrated remarkable potential to transform software development. However, applying these technologies to the high-performance computing (HPC) domain remains challenging. HPC code requires not only functional correctness but also a range of additional considerations, such as architecture-specific performance optimization, support for GPUs and Fortran, appropriate algorithm selection tailored to the target environment, and careful control of numerical accuracy. At the Information Technology Center of Nagoya University, we are advancing HPC-GENIE, a research and development project focused on applying generative AI to HPC code development. Rather than developing new models, we concentrate on designing AI agents built on existing models. In particular, we explore the potential of multi-agent systems in which multiple specialized agents collaborate to address complex HPC development tasks. We are also developing lightweight systems that operate entirely in local environments without relying on commercial services. In this talk, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects of AI-driven agents for HPC code development.
